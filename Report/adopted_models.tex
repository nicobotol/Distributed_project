\section{Adopted models}
\subsection{Communication system}\label{communication}
The adopted communication system has to allow the bidirectional data exchange between chutes moving in the space. For example, this can be achieved by using a UWB mounted on the payload which has typical communication range of 50 $\left[\si{\meter}\right]$ \cite{b11}.\\
The measurement of the absolute position is done using a GPS, with an uncertainty of 5 $\left[\si{\meter}\right]$ while for what concerns the relative measurement, multiple technologies can be used such as LIDAR, stereo camera or the combination of a UWB and a camera. For the seek of the thesis, it is assumed that the relative measurement can be done when the agents are closer than 50 $\left[\si{\meter}\right]$ and are provided with an uncertainty of 1 $\left[\si{\meter}\right]$. \textcolor{blue}{It is also assumed that each agent can measure its own orientation with respect to a fixed direction, but cannot measure the orientation of the others.}

\subsection{Simplified parachute model}
The considered parachutes are made of two main parts: a sail with finite radial dimensions and height and a payload with dimension negligible \textcolor{blue}{compared} the first. The latter is placed below the former and carries also the communication, measurement and control systems.\\
The most simple dynamical parachute model is linear, \textcolor{blue}{and considers} three actuators able to move the device in space, while gravity acts as non-controllable input along the vertical direction.

\textcolor{blue}{The uncertainties $\nu_x$, $\nu_y$, and $\nu_z$ model the wind disturbances and the error along the three directions ($\left[\nu_x \, \nu_y \,\nu_z \right]\sim\mathcal{N}\left(0_3, L\right)$), while $\bar{v_z}$ is the velocity at which the parachutes fall due to the gravity action. }
\textcolor{red}{
$\bar{v_z}$  is the non controllable input related to the gravity that pulls the parachite to the ground.\\
In this way, the total velocity in the z direction has been split into a non-controllable part, which is the one related to the gravity, and into a controllable one: in fact, a parachute can reduce its falling velocity by breaking until a minimum velocity or accelerate up to the maximum velocity given by its geometry.\\
Hence, the falling velocity has to be always constrained by two boundaries, an upper one given by the maximum falling velocity and a minimal one necessary to avoid the closure of the sail.\\
Following typical values for these physical parameters, for the simulation it has been chosen to set the maximum free-falling velocity to 55 $\left[\si{\meter\per\second}\right]$ \cite{b8}, and a maximum falling velocity when the parachute is opened equal to 4.87 $\left[\si{\meter\per\second}\right]$, considering a mass of 100 $\left[\si{\kilogram}\right]$, a drag coefficient of 1.5 and a parachute's area of 45 $\left[\si{\meter^2}\right]$,  $\bar{v}_{z,max} = \sqrt{\frac{2 \, m \, g}{c_p \, \rho \, A}} = 4.87 \left[\si{\meter\per\second}\right]$ \cite{b9}. \\
For what concern the minimum falling velocity, a value equal to the 25\% of the maximum velocity has been selected, as it is a parameter that highly depends on the physical parameters of the parachute and is is hard to define without real experiments.}\\
Even though a physical system able to provide the required displacement on the plane has not been identified, some minimal performances in displacement and errors in the actuation have been considered.
\subsection{Unicycle-like parachute model} \label{unicyle}
\textcolor{blue}{A more sophisticated analysis can consider that a real parachute can brake the fall and steer by toogling the lines connecting the sail and the payload, while it has only a forward velocity. These considerations suggest that it can be modelled as a unicycle, with eqations given by \autoref{eq:NL}.}
\input{NL_dynamics}
Hence, the control inputs are the forward velocity $V$, the rotational one $\omega$ and the falling breaks $\bar{v_z}$. 
\textcolor{blue}{Even though in a real parachute a minimum forward velocity is necessary to ensure the lift force, in this project the forward velocity has been assumed to bounded between 0 and a maximum value, to simplify the control laws.}\\
For what concerns the boundaries of the inputs, a maximum forward velocity of 13 $\left[\si{\meter\per\second}\right]$ has been selected \cite{b7} \cite{b10}, while the maximum rotation speed is 0.52 $\left[\si{\radian\per\second}\right]$. As for the control in the vertical direction, the same holds from the linear model.\\
