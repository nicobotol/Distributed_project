\section{Introduction}
The fields of distributed systems and optimal control play an essential role in modern problems, such as precision-guided parachutes for cargo delivery \cite{b2} \cite{b3}.\\
The aim of this project is to drive the centroid of a storm of falling parachutes from the initial releasing point to the desired lending target on the ground. To pursue this purpose, each agent has always to be able to identify the geometric centroid of the storm and has to move such that the new mean point position of the storm is defined by the motion trajectory planner. It must be noted that here the focus is on the mean point of the formation so that the single parachutes can land in the neighbourhood of the arrival location.\\
Along with the distribution of information and path control, collision avoidance is a critical requirement because any crash can lead to an uncontrolled fall of the agents.\\
The available hardware to each parachute is composed of some measurement systems allowing the localization in space, the communication between each other, and the measurement of relative distances.\\
\text{red}{The limitations of the scope of this project are the following: the dynamic of the parachutes is simplified, the actuators have not been prectical identified, two parachutes in the storm can either communicate with one another or cannot communicate at all (i.e. unidirectional communication is not taken into account)}.
